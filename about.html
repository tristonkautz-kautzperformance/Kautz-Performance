      <h1>About Kautz Performance</h1>
      <p>
        Kautz Performance is a small coaching project focused on practical,
        realistic training for real athletes—people with school, jobs, and
        other responsibilities who still want to perform at a high level.

      <h2>About Coach Kautz</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a teacher and track &amp; field coach who’s spent a lot of time
        experimenting on myself—especially with vertical jump training,
        sprinting, and in-season performance. This site is where I organize
        training for athletes I work with and share ideas that might help
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is steady, sustainable progress:
        jumping higher, running faster, and staying healthy enough to keep
        stacking good weeks.

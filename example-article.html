      <h2>Bad training vs. better training</h2>
      <p>
        Early on, I chased random exercises, crushed myself with volume, and
        expected my body to magically adapt. Over time, I realized that what
        matters most is a mix of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practicing the actual skill—jumping.</li>
        <li>Strength work that makes sense for that skill.</li>
        <li>Enough rest that you can show up and actually jump high.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What this means for you as an athlete</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re one of my athletes, your plan is built around those same ideas.
        We don’t chase soreness for the sake of it. We chase progress: higher
        jumps, faster approaches, and better consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you read your training plan, keep that in mind. It’s not about
        filling every possible day with work—it’s about stacking the right kind
        of work over and over.

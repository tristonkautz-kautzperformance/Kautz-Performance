        Example plan • This is just to show structure. Real plans are individualized.

      <p>
        This sample block is written as if you’re training 3–4 days per week
        with a focus on dunking or jumping higher. Volume and intensity would
        be adjusted based on you as an athlete.

      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <div class="plan-week">
        <h3>Day 1 – Jump session + lower body</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Approach jumps: 4 × 3 jumps (full rest between sets)</li>
          <li>Squats: 3 × 5 (moderate-heavy)</li>
          <li>Romanian deadlifts: 3 × 6–8</li>
          <li>Core work: 3 sets</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2 – Light plyos + upper body</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pogo jumps: 3 × 10–15</li>
          <li>Box push-ups: 3 × 8–12</li>
          <li>Row variation: 3 × 8–12</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 3 – Jump session + lighter lower body</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Approach jumps: 5 × 2 (focus on quality)</li>
          <li>Split squats: 3 × 6–8 each leg</li>
          <li>Calf raises: 3 × 12–15</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        Very similar structure to Week 1, with small adjustments in volume or
        load based on how you responded.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Day 1: Slight increase in squat load if last week felt solid.</li>
        <li>Day 2: Keep volume similar; focus on clean landings.</li>
        <li>Day 3: Same or slightly fewer jumps if you’re feeling beat up.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        Either a small step forward from Week 2 or a slight deload if you’ve
        had a lot of heavy life/training stress. The exact choice depends on
        the athlete.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Day 1: Quality jumps + 2–3 sets instead of 3–4 heavy sets.</li>
        <li>Day 2: Keep it light and snappy.</li>
        <li>Day 3: Slightly lower volume and focus on feeling bouncy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For real athletes, this page would include more specific sets, loads,
        and notes along with adjustments based on your check-ins.

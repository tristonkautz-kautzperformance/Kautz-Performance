      <h2>What is Kautz Performance?</h2>
      <p>
        Kautz Performance is a small, focused coaching project built around simple,
        effective training for athletes who want to sprint faster, jump higher,
        and perform better in-season without burning out.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is the hub for current athletes I’m working with, plus a place
        to share articles and training thoughts that anyone can read.

      <h2>For current athletes</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re currently working with me, your up-to-date training blocks and
        notes will live in the <strong>Athlete Portal</strong>. You’ll need the
        access code I gave you to view that page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll also find general resources here: warm-up routines, recovery
        guidelines, and explanations of how to read your training plan.
